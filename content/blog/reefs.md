## Summary:
Coral reefs around the world are bleaching and dying across the world due to changes in the oceans' temperature, among other things. This change in conditions kills the algae present within coral and, thus, eliminates the mutual symbiotic relationship between them. As a result, corals begin to bleach and, eventually, wither away. Common examples of this change include the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.

The above images contains data collected by the NOAA Satellite and Information Service, and depicts coral bleaching and ocean temperature data. Near Australia and the oceanic islands, there is a correlation between temperatures and coral bleaching. The alert levels are significantly higher near the equator.

### Things you can do
Ultimately, the bleaching of the reefs is occuring as a result of climate change. It'll take more than some of us to change the world, but it always helps to start small. You can try:
  - Reducing greenhouse gases
  - Contacting politicians

Do you live in Australia?
  - Clean the beaches
  - Protect the reefs from damage
  - Advocate to reduce bottom trawling or other dangerous methods of fishing
