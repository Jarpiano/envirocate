## Summary:
Water is one of the most sought after resources on this planet. It's a necessity and can be utilized for agriculture, energy production, and much more. Most importantly, however, is that humans need it to survive. Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, there is a severe lack of clean drinking water. Pollution is one of the many culprits contaminating our water today.

### Causes
Many water sources around the world, especially in poorer nations, are polluted. Sewage may be dumped into these water sources, making them unsafe to drink. Present within this sewage may be pathogens or chemicals obtained from medicines and other sources. In other water sources, oil may have contaminated the water, making it both unsafe to consume by humans and uninhabitable for organisms. Thus, this limits food sources as well.
  - Oil Spills
  - Sewage Dumping (Fecal matter, trash, etc.)
  - Plastics in the ocean
  - Stuck, old fishing equipment
