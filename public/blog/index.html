    "content": "Summary: Air pollution is a term specifically attributed to chemicals and particles produced by humans that often results in adverse environmental and medical effects. Often, these particles are concentrated in metropolitan and industrial centers, but may also show up in more rural/urban areas. Such examples include: Hotan (China), Delhi (India), etc.\nCriteria Air Pollutants: The six criteria air pollutants are designated by the EPA and include:\nCarbon Monoxide (CO) Lead (Pb) Ozone (O3) Particulate Matter (PM) Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Emissions Timeline Source: EPA (https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-national-summary) Emissions have decreased over the past 50 years. On the other hand, GDP and vehicle mileage has increased.\nAdvocacy Getting rid of air pollution starts with you! The most important step to reducing air pollution is starting at the invididual\u0026rsquo;s level. Here are some things you can do:\nDrive less Use a bike or public transportation Plant a tree or garden Use less energy Avoid dirty fuels On a larger scale, you can:\nJoin a protest advocating for change Write a letter to your congressman Organize a community Resources Seeking an organization?\nhttps://www.cleanairfund.org/ https://www.4cleanair.org/ Looking for something local?\nHouston: https://airalliancehouston.org/ UK: https://www.ukcleanair.org/ Asia: https://cleanairasia.org/ ",

    "content": "Summary: Coral reefs around the world are bleaching and dying across the world due to changes in the oceans\u0026rsquo; temperature, among other things. This change in conditions kills the algae present within coral and, thus, eliminates the mutual symbiotic relationship between them. As a result, corals begin to bleach and, eventually, wither away. Common examples of this change include the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.\nMap Source: NOAA (https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/) The above images contains data collected by the NOAA Satellite and Information Service, and depicts coral bleaching and ocean temperature data. Near Australia and the oceanic islands, there is a correlation between temperatures and coral bleaching. The alert levels are significantly higher near the equator.\nThings you can do Ultimately, the bleaching of the reefs is occuring as a result of climate change. It\u0026rsquo;ll take more than some of us to change the world, but it always helps to start small. You can try:\nReducing greenhouse gases Contacting politicians Do you live in Australia?\nClean the beaches Protect the reefs from damage Advocate to reduce bottom trawling or other dangerous methods of fishing Resources Want to donate?\nhttps://rrf.org.au/ https://coral.org/en/ \u0026ldquo;Adopt A Coral:\u0026rdquo; https://www.coralguardian.org/en/ ",

    "content": "Summary Climate change is the phenomenon where there are shifts in the current temperature, climate, and weather. Although it is normal for the planet to experience drastic changes in climate, the period by which the climate is changing is much shorter than previous records. This can have drastic consequences as the climate is changing too fast for people to adapt. Many animal and plant species are also in danger as these new conditions are beyond their range of tolerance. Natural disasters are also more commons because hurricanes are more prolific as the oceans warm.\nCauses Climate change is caused by a variety of factors.\nDeforestation Burning fossil fuels (Greenhouse gases) Food Production Manufactoring Industry Energy Production and Consumption Transportation Deforestation Deforestation is the process by which forests are cleared. The reasons for this include many. Land may be cleared to make way for agriculture, herding/randing, residential/urban development, lumber production, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that trees are being cut down for all of this. The problem occurs when too many trees are removed compared to how many are grown. As a result, less trees are able to sequestrate carbon from the atmosphere. In addition to that, carbon dioxide released from the activities concerning deforestation, such as lumber production and burning, exceed carbon dioxide absorbed through photosynthesis.\nFood Production The food industry is a major culprit in the production of greenhouse gases. In agriculture alone, forests are cleared to make way for cornfields or other mass produced cash crops. Meanwhile, in the meat industry, vast amounts of methane are produced. Methane is produced when animals metabolize in the absense of oxygen. This phenomenon is more critical in cows because of the amount they eat and the heavy demand for beef.\nEnergy Production In the U.S., the majority of energy produced and consumed is dervied from nonrenewable fossil fuels. The widespread of fossil fuels is accompanied by the production of greenhouse gases as well. The production and consumption of petroleum products outputs a variety of chemicals into the air such as carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide. For natural gas, methane is the main gas produced and is often produced in operations such as fracking.\nTransportation As cars became more affordable, more were bought and, consequently, increasing amounts of gas were produced. Carbon monoxide, another greenhouse gas, is produced by cars and plays a major factor in climate change because of the widespread use of fossil fueled automobiles. Planes, trains, and buses also create greenhouse gases.\nAdvocacy Curbing climate change starts with you! You can:\nUse public transportation or bike Use renewable sources of energy Reducing your consumption of meat products Advocate for change by sending a letter to your congressman Resources https://climatenetwork.org/ Houston: http://greenhoustontx.gov/climateactionplan/ https://www.edf.org/ ",
